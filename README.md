# Visualizing Music and Emotions Throughout Metatron: From Audio Analysis to Music Generation

## Description
This project revolutionizes audio analysis and music creation by addressing the limitations of traditional methods, particularly in representing emotions through music. Conventional techniques often rely on basic, two-dimensional plots, limiting users from fully exploring the nuanced relationship between music and emotions.

This system integrates sacred geometry with advanced visualization techniques and AI-driven music generation, creating a seamless experience that allows users to explore and generate music in an intuitive, visually-driven manner.

The project consists of three interconnected clients:

1. **Latent Space Client (LSC)**: A 3D audio visualization tool that lets users interactively analyze audio features.
2. **Metatron Client (MC)**: A sacred geometry-based tool that maps emotions to audio features using shapes like Metatron’s Cube.
3. **Generative Client (GC)**: An AI-based music generation platform that uses visual placeholders instead of written prompts to create music.

This system allows users to visualize, analyze, and generate music in a continuous loop, offering an immersive and intuitive interface.

## Features
- 3D audio visualization through customizable axes.
- Integration of sacred geometry (e.g., Metatron’s Cube) for emotion-to-audio mapping.
- AI-driven music generation without the need for written prompts.
- Real-time interaction and feedback across all clients.

## Technologies Used

### Frontend:
- **JavaScript**
- **CSS**
- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **React Three Fiber (r3f)**: A powerful renderer for Three.js within React.

### Backend:
- **Python**
- **Flask**: A lightweight WSGI web framework for Python.
- **Essentia**: An open-source library for audio analysis and music information retrieval.
- **NumPy**: A library for numerical computing in Python.

### Other:
- **WebSocket**: Used for real-time communication between the clients, enabling dynamic interaction.
