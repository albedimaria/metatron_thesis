/*Descriptors and Their Geometric Representation

Key and Scale:      Define the foundational shape of the geometry. For instance, a major key could be represented by a solid with more symmetry, like an octahedron, while a minor key might correspond to a dodecahedron, representing more complexity.
Key Strength:       Determines the clarity or opacity of the geometry. A stronger key might result in a more opaque and defined geometry, while a weaker key strength might result in a more translucent shape.
Mood:               Dictates the overall 'element' or essence of the geometry. For example, a 'happy' mood might correspond to a tetrahedron (fire), while a 'sad' mood might correspond to an icosahedron (water).
Tempo:              Influences the size or frequency of vertices. A faster tempo might mean a geometry with more vertices, while a slower tempo might have fewer, larger faces.
Danceability:       Relates to the dynamic nature of the geometry. Higher danceability might suggest a more kinetic or animated geometric form, possibly one that is rotating or has moving parts.
Dynamic Complexity: Reflects the intricacy of the geometry. Music with high dynamic complexity could be represented by a compound solid or a solid with intricate patterns on its surfaces.
Global Loudness:    Impacts the scale of the geometry. Louder music could be represented by a larger geometric form.
Valence:            Affects the color or brightness of the geometry. High valence could result in a brightly colored solid, while low valence could be darker or more muted.
Arousal:            Modulates the sharpness of the vertices and edges. High arousal could produce sharper edges, while low arousal might result in rounded corners.
Color:              Can be literally translated to the color of the geometry, with different hues representing different colors in the music.
Emotion:            Directly affects the shape chosen to represent the music. For example, joy might be a sphere for its completeness, while anger might be a jagged form like a stellated dodecahedron.
Timbre:             Determines the texture of the geometry's surface. A rich timbre might result in a complex, varied surface, while a dull timbre might be smooth or flat.
Instrument:         Specific instruments could be associated with specific materials or finishes on the geometry (e.g., strings with a silky texture, brass with a metallic sheen).
Approachability:    Influences the accessibility of the geometry. A more approachable piece could be represented by a solid that has an inviting texture or openings.
Engagement:         Affects the interactive aspect of the geometry. Highly engaging music might result in a solid that seems to reach out or fit together with others.
Harmonicity:        Reflects the regularity and symmetry of the geometry. High harmonicity might result in a perfectly regular solid, while lower harmonicity might lead to an asymmetric shape.


Emotional State and Geometric Representation
Combining all these elements, we could conceive of a complex, dynamic geometric structure
that symbolizes the music's emotional essence.

For instance, a piece of music that is major, joyful, with high danceability and arousal,
might be represented by a bright, animated, symmetric octahedron with sharp edges and a textured surface that rotates
or pulsates in a way that seems inviting and engaging.

This symbolic representation is inherently subjective and abstract, as it relies on metaphor and personal interpretation. However, it offers a unique, creative way to visualize the emotional landscape of a piece of music through geometry.


Cube (Stability, Grounded): Solemn, Serene, Laid-back, Steady
These emotions and rhythms convey stability and groundedness, akin to the solid base and equal faces of a cube.

Tetrahedron (Change, Dynamic): Energetic, Triumphant, Joyful, Uptempo, Driving, Pulse-pounding
The sharp points and edges of a tetrahedron reflect the dynamic and active nature of these states.

Octahedron (Balance, Reflection): Pensive, Playful, Relaxed, Swinging, Flowing
An octahedron's even structure is reminiscent of balanced and reflective emotions, as well as rhythms that have a relaxed flow or playful swing.

Icosahedron (Movement, Changeability): Restless, Yearning, Hopeful, Chaotic, Frantic, Meandering
The icosahedron, with more faces and edges, suggests complexity and a range of emotional shifts, suitable for representing movement and changeability.

Dodecahedron (Mystery, Complexity): Mystical, Dreamy, Melancholic, Nostalgic, Hypnotic
The dodecahedron, often associated with the universe, can symbolize the depth and complexity of these introspective and reflective emotional
